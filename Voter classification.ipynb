Then, sample precincts are selected, and local interviewers are hired and trained. Then, at those precincts, the local interviewer approaches a subset of voters as they exit the polls (for example, every third voter, or every fifth voter, depending on the required sample size).\n","\n","When a voter is approached, they are asked if they are willing to fill out a questionnaire. Typically about 40-50% agree. (For those that decline, the interviewer visually estimates their age, race, and gender, and notes this information, so that the response rate by demographic is known and responses can be weighted accordingly in order to be more representative of the population.)\n","\n","Voters that agree to participate are then given an form with 15-20 questions. They fill in the form (anonymously), fold it, and put it in a small ballot box.\n","\n","Three times during the day, the interviewers will stop, take the questionnaires, compile the results, and call them in to the Edison Research phone center. The results are reported immediately to the media organizations that are consortium members.\n","\n","In addition to the poll of in-person voters, absentee and early voters (who are not at the polls on Election Day) are surveyed by telephone."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HZJUigsK3ox4"},"source":["### Download the data and documentation\n","\n","The exit poll data is not freely available on the web, but is available to those with institutional membership.

that ties are handled - when there are multiple samples in the training set with the same distance - is not ideal.\n","\n","We’ll discuss both of these, but we’ll only fix the second one in this section. Part of *your* assignment will be to address the issue with the custom distance metric in your solution."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ldOFwyi93oyC"},"source":["In the example with the “mini” training and test sets, you may have noticed a problem: training sample 10379, which has all NaN values, has zero distance to *every* test sample according to our distance function. (Note that the first column in the distance matrix, corresponding to the first training sample, is all zeros.)\n","\n","This means that this sample will be a “nearest neighbor” of *every* test sample! But, it’s not necessarily *really* similar to those other test samples. We just *don’t have any information* by which to judge how similar it is to other samples. These values are *unknown*, not *similar*.\n","\n","The case with an all-NaN training sample is a bit extreme, but it illustrates how our simple distance metric is problematic in other situations as well. In general, when there are no missing values, for a pair of samples each feature is either *similar* or *different*. Thus a metric like L1 distance, which explicitly measures the extent to which features are *different*, also implicitly captures the extent to which features are *similar*. When samples can have missing values, though, for a pair of samples each feature is either *similar*, *different*, or *unknown* (one or both samples is missing that value). In this case, a distance metric that only measures the extent of *difference* (like L1 or L2 distance) does not capture whether the features that are not different are *similar* or *unknown*. (Our custom distance metric, which is an L1 distance, treats values that are *unknown* as if they are *similar* - neither one increases the distance.) Similarly, a distance metric that only measures the extent of *similarity* would not capture whether the features that are not similar are *different* or *unknown*.\n","\n","So when there are NaNs, our custom distance metric does not quite behave the way we want - we want distance between two samples to decrease with more similarity, and to increase with more differences. Our distance metric only considers difference, not similarity.\n","\n","For example, consider these two samples from the original

Note that `numpy` includes many functions that are helpful when working with arrays that have NaN values, including mathematical functions like [sum](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.nansum.html), [product](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.nanprod.html), [max](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.nanmax.html) and [min](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.nanmin.html), and logic functions like [isnan](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.isnan.html)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jM_6ytHr3oyE"},"source":["#### Implement your distance metric"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"c0jcJ7Vd3oyE"},"outputs":[],"source":["# TODO - implement distance metric\n","\n","def custom_distance(a, b):\n","    # Make sure inputs are numpy arrays\n","    a = np.array(a)\n","    b = np.array(b)\n","\n","    # Broadcast a to have the same shape as b\n","    a = np.broadcast_to(a, b.shape)\n","\n","    # Rule 1: if two samples are identical, the distance between them should be zero.\n","    mask_identical = np.isclose(a, b, equal_nan=True)\n","    identical_distance = np.zeros_like(a)\n","\n","    # Rule 2: as the extent of difference between two samples increases, the distance should increase.\n","    mask_different = np.logical_and(~mask_identical, np.isfinite(a) & np.isfinite(b))\n","    different_distance = np.abs(a - b)\n","\n","    # Rule 3: as the extent of similarity between two samples increases, the distance should decrease.\n","    # Here, we interpret this rule to mean that a feature being identical should reduce the distance.\n","    # Already handled by Rule 1\n","\n","    # Rule 4: if in a pair of samples one or both have a NaN value for a given feature,\n","    # the similarity or difference of this feature is unknown.\n","    # Your distance metric should compute a smaller distance for a pair of samples with\n","    # many similarities (even if there is some small difference) than for a pair of samples\n","    # with mostly unknown similarity.\n","    mask_nan = np.isnan(a) | np.isnan(b)\n","    nan_distance = np.full_like(a, 0.5)  # Fill with a value less than 1 (smallest possible non-zero absolute difference)\n","\n","    # Combine all distances\n","    combined_mask = mask_identical | mask_different | mask_nan\n","    distances = np.where(mask_identical, identical_distance,\n","                         np.where(mask_different, different_distance,\n","                                  np.where(mask_nan, nan_distance, 0.0)))\n","    total_distance = np.nansum(distances, axis=-1)\n","\n","    return total_distance\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IlICRpNF3oyF"},"source":["#### Test cases for your distance metric"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NtZMK26z3oyF"},"source":["You can use these test samples to check your work.

Mutual Information between two variables measures the dependence of one variable on the other. It is a good scoring function for this problem because it effectively captures the importance of each feature with respect to the target variable, even if the relationship is non-linear or involves interactions between features. As for handling missing values, I used the SimpleImputer function from sklearn to replace missing values with the mean value of the respective feature. This is a common technique to handle missing data and allows us to compute mutual information without having to discard any features."],"metadata":{"id":"PjVfNaJEVm-P"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The approach I chose is well suited for this data and this model because K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) considers each feature equally when calculating distances. Therefore, scaling features based on their importance (i.e., mutual information with the target variable) can improve the performance of KNN by emphasizing more relevant features.\n","\n","However, there are some limitations to this approach. Firstly, the method assumes that all features are independent, which might not always be the case. Also, using mutual information might not be optimal when there are a large number of irrelevant features, as these will still be included in the model, albeit with lower weights. Additionally, imputing missing values with the mean does not account for possible underlying data patterns, potentially introducing bias into our
